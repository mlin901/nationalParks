## Description

Parks & Trek is a fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) application that allows a user to create an account and then search for National Parks in the US based on specific states. Once the user has signed up and/or is logged in, they can then save parks to their wishlist. Once the user has added the desired amount of parks to their wishlist they can then view those parks on a map.
